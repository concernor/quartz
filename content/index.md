Start from the [[Origins]] to understand where the inspiration came from. Then go through the: 
- [[roadmap]] for the current plans
- [[change-log]] to see what has been done so far
- [[00 - index|idea tank]] to see into the possibilities of the future.

We are currently on the ideation phase and many of the things you see here can change. However if you for some reason ever stumble upon this page, you are very very early... early on the level of I didn't even tell anyone that I am working on something. 

So far I have just built it silently and occasionally posted things on social media. Any like/follow ...etc. is much appreciated. Also reach out if you have any suggestions/wishes.
