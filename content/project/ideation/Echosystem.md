up:: [[00 - index|idea tank]]


the idea would be to create a way to echo the concerns through the accounts belonging to concern on different platforms. Thought to be similar to [ANON Cast](https://x.com/anoncast_) but not anonymous and way more affordable.

- User pays [[CONCERN|$CONCERN]] to echo their concerns.
- [[CONCERN|$CONCERN]] is returned to treasury to be used in ecosystem fund.
- A special concern NFT gets minted.
- Contents (text) of the NFT gets broadcasted on x and farcaster.
- User/Community/Anyone can put up a bounty on the concern if it is deemed worthy.
